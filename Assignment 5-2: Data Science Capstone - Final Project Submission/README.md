# Problem Statement # 
In the face of widespread layoffs and changing workforce dynamics, how can we navigate these challenges effectively to build resilience and foster sustainable employment practices that benefit both individuals and organizations?
# Project Aim and Insights #
We have developed an HR analytics dashboard that integrates sentiment analysis to understand employee reactions during layoffs. By analyzing feedback from social media posts and other text data, we gain insights into the emotional impacts of layoffs. Our goal is to improve user experience, promoting employee mobility, and ensuring compliance. By Using sentiment analysis, HR teams can better understand the impacts of layoffs and adjust their policies and management approaches accordingly. Our AI-driven analytics provide actionable insights to support proactive decision-making.
# Dataset and Methodologies # 
 Our project utilizes two main datasets: raw data on employee layoffs, including details like names, affected departments, dates, and reasons for termination. The second dataset comprises unstructured textual data from employee tweets, capturing feedback, sentiments, and perceptions related to HR activities.	For the front end, we've used VS Code and Streamlit to enhance accessibility and usability for HR professionals and recruiters.The backend with Python, with Firebase as our database solution. Weâ€™ve integrated OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model as a Large Language Model.
## The scope of our project is mid-level human resources departments within companies
